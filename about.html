              <h2>My Story</h2>
              <p>Andrew Yaspan began his professional career in New Orleans after graduating from Bucknell University in 2011.  While studying at Bucknell, Andrew earned a degree in Political Science and a minor in Philosophy.  Beyond his studies, Andrew was an active member of the Bucknell community.  Activities included playing Rugby for four years, developing a multimedia symposium with faculty, chairing the community service committee for the Kappa Sigma Fraternity, holding the position of Treasurer for the Bucknell African Student Association, studying abroad in Prague, and tutoring children at nearby housing developments for three and a half years.</p>

              <p>Upon graduating, Andrew fulfilled his desire to explore a completely different part of the country than where he grew up in New York.  The opportunity to move down to New Orleans came in August 2011 when Andrew accepted a position to become an Americorps Site Supervisor with the St. Bernard Project.  In the position Andrew managed volunteer groups of up to 30 people in rebuilding Hurricane Katrina flood-damaged homes.  During his time in the position, Andrew implemented many organizational techniques for both management and communication that have proven value in Andrew’s other career pursuits.</p>

              <p>While his experience at the St. Bernard Project was an incredible professional experience and introduction to the New Orleans community, Andrew wanted to pursue other goals of seeking out appropriate roles to be involved in both local and national systemic change.  Although Andrew began to pursue this during his time at the St. Bernard Project by becoming an intern with a community organization, Safe Streets Strong Communities, he wanted to devote more time and energy towards this particular goal.

              <p>Shaped by both local conversation and an increasingly developed understanding of New Orleans’ recovering social, cultural, and political ecosystems, Andrew made the decision to work in Education and ultimately the vast domain of Public Health.  Andrew was attracted to the opportunity to advocate for New Orleans parents and children from inside the school system, and ultimately discovered an infatuation with an intersectional and more birds-eye view of local issues through the Social Determinants of Health lens (via Public Health).</p>

             
              <p>Andrew would eventually accept a job offer to help jumpstart the New Orleans Health Department’s effort to get people enrolled in affordable health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.  To date a coalition of New Orleans Marketplace assisters has enrolled over 20,000 people in the city for health insurance.  The job combined Andrew’s fascination with public policy, public health, behavior, and economics, as well as allowed him to continue making connections and developing relationships in the community that would help both professional and personal philanthropic endeavors.</p>

              <p>Andrew is actively involved in many civic and social justice minded initiatives including but not limited to Voice of the Ex-Offender, The First 72, Orleans Place Matters Coalition, and Operation Spark.  Andrew also contributes to and engages the local organizing, tech, political, and youth communities in various capacities.</p>

              <p>Andrew enjoys self-studies (MOOCs or otherwise), working out, playing music and embracing the many aspects of New Orleans culture in his spare time.</p>
