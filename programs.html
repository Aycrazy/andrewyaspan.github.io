        <h5>Boot Camp : Fundamentals in Four Weeks</h5>

        <p>We present life as a professional software developer in 4 weeks, introducing youth to the daily workflow and awesomeness of building software.  By end of camp, our participants are on their way to being super users with the command-line and file-system, and they leave literate in the basics of JavaScript having built several apps and games in Node.js and HTML5.  They can debug an app and problem solve on the Internet, and know where to find the resources to continue learning on their own or in teams.  They also learn the soft skills that make them a great team player.</p>

        <p>We've found that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY" target="_blank">short, concentrated immersion and undistracted practice</a> is effective in bringing students as quickly as possible to the doorway of self-directed learning.  To excel at programming or any field, commit 20 solid concentrated hours of your time, learn enough to become self-critical, and you'll be amazed at how quickly you advance!</p>

        <p>If you'd like to participate in our next boot camp or you'd like to host one of our boot camps at your learning center, <a href="contact.html">please get in touch!</a></p>

        <h5>Studio Spark : A Year of Workforce Apprenticeship</h5>

        <p>We are prototyping our Studio Spark program over 2014 - 2015 by talking on a select number of client projects, wherein graduates of our boot camps, those who've continued to demonstrate the desire to go deeper into the field, are brought onto teams as interns and mentored by professional software developers to implement project requirements.</p>

        <p>If you have an app or website you'd like Operation Spark and our Studio Spark kids to build, <a href="contact.html">please feel free to discuss your needs with us!</a></p>
