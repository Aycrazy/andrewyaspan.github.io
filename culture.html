            <h3>Culture of Code</h3>
            <p>At Operation Spark we have fun with the serious stuff, and hold ourselves, our students, staff and mentors, to high standards when it comes to our behaviour while learning and working together. We ask each of our participants to help us live up to these standards by actively working with a set of standards that help guide us into awesomeness!</p>

            <div class="well">
              <h3>Here's our deal</h3>
              <h5>Your mission</h5>
              <p>To learn the skills required to become a fantastic software developer and become the type of amazing person with whom others love to work.</p>
              <h5>Your tools</h5>
              <p>Your fearless leaders, your close-knit team, a great attitude, and an openness to learn.</p>
              <h5>Your future</h5>
              <p>Operation Spark is an opportunity for you to learn real world skills and become an elite software development. Through immersive experiences, you and your fellow teammates will learn the required skills to become the best programmer around.</p>

              <p>Operation Spark is built on the idea of community and supporting each other to get to the next level of achievement. Our Culture of Code is designed to help you develop into a programming machine while also allowing you to develop into a fantastic human being.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>What if I'm having trouble with these principles?</h3>
            <p>These 10 values are meant to help guide you on the path towards success. It’s an agreement that you must make with yourself and your Operation Spark team when you choose to participate in our program. Are you expected to do all of these things perfectly all the time? Absolutely not. But to help keep each of us accountable, when we witness behaviour in our teammates that goes against the Operation Spark Culture of Code, simply ask them the question, “Is that an antipattern?” or “Are you for real?”, so we can keep each other in check.</p>

            <h3>The Details</h3>


            <div id="change">
              <h4>1. Be willing to change</h4>
              <p>You are going to learn a lot over the course of your Operation Spark training. Some of these things will be easy, and some of these things will be new, but above all, you’ve got to be willing to change. Commit to changing yourself toward better learning, better productivity, better professional conduct, and better community.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="team">
              <h4>2. Team means family</h4>
              <p>One of the first things you will learn in software development is that your team is everything. A final app is only as good as the team that built it. When you have a team that is open and care for each other, that is when great apps are built.</p>

              <p>Your Operation Spark team is not only your team, but also your family. Everyone is here to learn how to become a great software developer, so do your best to build each other up. Be willing to learn from your family, help them grow, and encourage their efforts. You will be amazed what you can accomplish with a laptop, Internet connection, and the support of a great team.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="accept">
              <h4>3. Fully accept others and yourself</h4>
              <p>Because your Operation Spark team is your family, you must accept them for who they are. This group will be in the trenches with you and working towards becoming kickass software developers too. It is important that you acknowledge and embrace each other’s differences.</p>

              <p>You are all equals and you are no better than the person next to you. You must be conscientious that the people on either side of you are not one and the same - everyone is unique. Some people are uniquely geeky, some people are shy, some people are outgoing, some people are white, some people are black, and some people are gay. Accept them for who they are and embrace their differences.</p>

              <p>Fully accepting others and yourself applies to name calling and intolerance as well. Any form of sexism and not treating your fellow men and women as equals, will not be tolerated. Human society is diverse; if we want to live in harmony, there must be universal acceptance. Ask yourself this: How can I expect people to accept me for who I am if I cannot accept others in their diversity? If we want the best ideas and best teams, we have to include everyone, so Operation Spark reflects diversity toward quality.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="jerk">
              <h4>4. Don't be a jerk</h4>
              <p>At Operation Spark, we accept everyone for who they are. We encourage you to be your true self and become whatever you want to be, except a jerk. Here’s why:</p>

              <p>Being a jerk gets you no where. It stunts your growth, limits your maturity, and is poison for those around you. People stop respecting you when you’re being a jerk and no one wants to be around someone like that. As young adults, you are on the verge of having to make your way in the world, and if you can’t show yourself to be mature, trustworthy and capable, people will begin to move away from you, and eventually you’ll find yourself struggling. This will deeply affect your success and our mission is for you to succeed.</p>

              <p>So don’t be a jerk. Jerks ruin teams and friendships. Our aim at Operation Spark is to create a safe space founded on openness and acceptance. Be inclusive, not exclusive. All races, all religious beliefs, all ethnicities, all genders, gay, lesbian, transgender, all ages - everyone is welcome and equal at Operation Spark.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="new">
                <h4>5. Notthing is hard, only new</h4>
                <p>The great Jon Clayton, world-class jazz bass player, composer and arranger, instructs that nothing is hard, only new. Anything worth comprehending requires work, and although it may be difficult to you at first, that is only because it is unfamiliar. Try not to get frustrated. Just relax and let yourself enjoy the learning process.</p>

                <p>You can think of acquiring knowledge like walking into a dark room for the first time. You’re not going to know where the furniture is positioned, you’ll be bumping into things and banging around, dropping your belongings, but, a few more times through the room, and you’ll know where the paths are, and clearly see in the dark.</p>

                <p>The same goes for programming. You may struggle initially and will need to put in some work to get over the first major hump. But as with anything, you will get better with practice - constant, consistent and concentrated practice. Ask any world class musician, like Mr. Clayton, how he or she sounded the first time they picked up their instrument and attempted to make a sound. They will grin from ear to ear laughing at the memory of their younger self. Remember - nothing is hard, it’s only new.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="focus">
                <h4>6. You can do it! Just focus.</h4>
                <p>To really become a great programmer, you’re going to have to stay focused. Otherwise, you’ll fall behind and will regret not taking advantage of this unique opportunity.</p>

                <p>Focus is less of a mental exercise and more of a test of self-discipline. The best way to focus is to remove all distractions while you’re in class and while you’re studying and working on assignments at home. Turn off your smart phones, don’t surf the Net, don’t watch YouTube or TV, don’t Facebook, and you will be surprised at what you can accomplish. If you don’t remove distractions from your work, you’ll be wasting valuable opportunities and developing habits unconducive to better learning and productivity. Don’t let these distractions drag you down. You want to give yourself and your team the best opportunity to succeed, so you must be willing to focus and buckle down.</p>

                <p>We are not asking you to never surf the web or watch TV ever again. All we are asking is for you to dedicate part of your day to Operation Spark. Whether that’s 10 minutes or 2 hours, concentrated focus will help you greatly accelerate your development. Watch : The First 20 Hours and you will see that you can become reasonably proficient in any skill in just 20 hours of concentrated focus!</p>

                <div class="well">
                  <h4>Effective Learning</h4>
                  <p>Make the best of your time, really! In Josh Kaufman’s book, The First 20 Hours, he argues that reasonable proficiency in anything can be attained within 20 concentrated hours. To achieve this, you must:</p>

                  <h5>Practice intelligently</h5>
                  <p>Deconstruct the skill by deciding what you want to be able to do, then break down the skill into smaller steps.</p>

                  <h5>Learn enough to self correct</h5>
                  <p>Get good resources (stackoverflow, books, mentors and meetups) and build something. Learn just enough to self correct while creating something like an app, a command-line util, or a game.</p>

                  <h5>Remove barriers to practicing</h5>
                  <p>This includes your phone, internet, TV, food, and temporarily, even friends who might not understand you desire to learn effectively.</p>

                  <h5>Practice undistracted for at least 20 hours</h5>
                  <p>Stick with it through the first few hours of frustration - it’s only 20 hours. Once you pass the first 4 hours, you will begin to improve dramatically.</p>

                  <h5>Understand the largest barrier is emotional</h5>
                  <p>The major barrier to skill acquisition is NOT intellectual, it’s emotional. No one likes to feel stupid - but by wanting to avoid feeling awkward, people often rob themselves of self development! So, relax, don’t panic, don't worry about feeling like a fish outta wather - we got your back! Take it easy on yourself, and enjoy learning.</p>

                  <p>So, get to know your stuff! You don’t have to know everything (you’ll learn as you go), but what you do know, know it well! Stay focused, stay on target, it’s only 20 hours.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

              <div id="self">
                <h4>7. Be Self-Sufficient, Accountable, Autodidactic</h4>
                <p>To be great at anything, you’ve got to have a passion for learning, and you must learn to learn.  Become autodidactic - a self directed learner.  This skill, combined with kindness towards others, will be the most important skills you will ever foster in yourself.  They will carry you through career changes and any type of social situation.</p>


                <p>At Operation Spark, we’re going to push you to be your best.  If you’re not willing to let us help you or if you are not willing to approach this fearlessly, then maybe Operation Spark isn’t for you.  That’s completely okay and we understand.  But at the same time, we know you can do it because we’ve seen others before you do it and do it well.   We want you to have this amazing opportunity to improve your skills and improve yourself, but it must start from you.  You have to work not against us, but join the team and work with us.</p>

                <p>So what does this actually mean?  To become great at software engineer, you must become self-reliant and a great problem solver.  Keep in mind that everyone’s time is valuable and the answer is usually right at your fingertips.  Before asking a question, you must ask yourself:</p>

                <div class="well">
                  <h3>The Golden Rules of Self Sufficiency</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Did I Google my question(s) first?</li>
                    <li>Did I search our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/operation-spark" target="_blank">Operation Spark Google Group</a> first for an answer to my question?</li>
                    <li>Did I check other forums, like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stackoverflow?</a></li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                <p>Many developers have come across the same problems you are trying to solve, and many other developers have helped solve those problems with well documented solutions.  Don't panic when you get stuck!  Do some research on Google and you will most likely find the solutions to your conundrum.  It may be that someone has asked and someone has answered your exact same question.  You will get the highest badge of honor, the INFORMATION SURVIVALIST BADGE, in recognition of your self reliance.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, don't be afraid to share the answers to your own questions!  This will increase our knowledgebase and may help someone else on your team significantly.  Remember, the better everyone on your team becomes, the better you will become.</p>
              </div>

              <div id="better">
                <h4>8. Yours is not better than theirs</h4>
                <p>Competition is sometimes a great thing and can really push people to become better at something really quickly.  We want you to push each other to be better software developers and people, but we want you to do it in a constructive manner.</p>

                <p>If you understand a concept, that’s great!  But if you see that your teammate next to you is struggling, don’t brag about how you get it.  Help them!!  Kudos to you if you’re a fast learner, but you have to acknowledge that your team is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>  

                <p>Understand your strengths and weaknesses and lean on your teammates’ strengths when you need them.  You will excel at certain parts of computer programming and you will struggle on others.  Don’t push others down in an attempt to make yourself seem like “the best software programmer”.  Again, software is built by great teams and it’s counterproductive to make someone else feel inadequate and less-than.  By bragging about yourself, you are damaging other’s path towards learning, when you should be helping them surpass any emotional barrier that’s holding them back.</p>
              </div>
            <div id="listen">
            <h4>9. Listen First, Talk Second</h4>

            <p>One of the most important things you should acknowledge in your life is that you don’t know everything.  Embrace “I know what I don’t know” and “I don’t know what I don’t know”.  Listen to those around you who are knowledgeable and always think before speaking.  This is an invaluable skill and is what separates the great programmers from the good ones.</p>

            <p>It is most probable that in any situation that you haven’t thought of all the solutions.  Given the nature of human beings, we have a limited perspective, and therefore can’t see all the sides of something at the same time.  Just have a look at any object in front of you now: can you see the back of this object?  Do you know if there’s a monkey on the other side of your computer screen or a lizard clinging to the back of your iPhone right now?  No you don’t, but with the help of someone on the other side of the object, you can.</p>

            <p>The best programmers we’ve ever worked with have also been the most humble, most generous, and most giving people.  They are hungry for knowledge, so they never miss an opportunity to listen and learn.  Try to be that person.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="mentor">
            <h4>10. Be Mentored and Be a Mentor</h4>

            <p>Throughout your Operation Spark experience, there are going to be a variety of professionals that come and spend time with you.  They are going to have years of experience and will seem ever so wise.  This is your chance!  If you really jive with someone, don’t hesitate to ask them to be your mentor.  The best way to accelerate your development is to learn from people who have done it before.  They will save you several hours of time with just a couple minutes of advice - you just have to ask!</p>

            <p>To create a great relationship with your mentor, it is also important to be a great mentee.  These professionals are dedicating their time and effort to help you, so you must be appreciative and grateful for their help.  Be accountable and follow through with your mentor, so they continue to invest in you and help guide you through your journey to becoming a super awesome software developer.</p>

            <p>We also want you to remember that we are not a school.  You chose to apply to Operation Spark and we chose to accept you based on your desire to learn, your willingness to change, and your ability to play nice with others.  But very soon, we want you to start thinking of us as your colleagues.  We are not your school teachers or principals, and we are definitely not your bosses.  The only rules you must respect are outlined in this document.  On that note, it is okay to also mentor your mentors.  Be open and honest and provide feedback when solicited.  This is a great way for you to be a great mentee and help your mentor get better as well.</p>
            </div>
