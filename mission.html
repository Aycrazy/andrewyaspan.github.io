        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>80% of low-income students drop out of college strapped with debt, and in New Orleans, where a third of the city lives in poverty, that’s left us with 20,000 young adults, ages 16 to 25, not in school, unemployed, and the impact of this on our communities is devastating.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, as of July 2014, 3000 positions in software development in the state of Louisiana remain unfilled.</p>

        <p>Through our mentorship programs, Operation Spark is opening a new door to prosperity for disconnected youth by presenting the fastest route to a career in software development, helping youth develop themselves, their skills and build strong careers.</p>

        <h5>Concretely</h5>

        <p>Focusing on New Orleans, where generational poverty is an issue, we are concerned with developing and distributing effective learning tools and programs to help circumvent the costs of higher education and provide accelerated workforce development.</p>

        <p>What does that mean concretely? We learn to write software using industrial tools, writing actual apps, working in an awesome team environment, while becoming self sufficient by taking an autodidactic approach to higher education and problem solving.</p>

        <h5>A Career for Everyone</h5>

        <p>The field of software development is quite wide.  Computer programming or coding is less than 50% of what goes into an app or website.  And so no matter your interests or apptitude, there's certainly a career for you in software development, you just need to build a few apps with an awesome team to start discovering all that software has to offer and to find your place in it.</p>

        <p>The skills involved in building mobile video games and apps are quite varied, including application design, game mechanics and user experience, visual and sound design, computer engineering of various sorts, quality assurance, project, product and cost management, content management and public relations of all kinds.  And each of these skills lead to careers, careers with futures - for example, an entry level quality assurance analyst is a well paying position, and can lead to management or a career as a UX designer.

        <p>Working in teams, inherently a part of software development, also introduces youth to effective means of communication and conflict resolution.</p>

        <p>The Operation Spark model is simple: By introducing young adults to this wide set of skills and helping them apply these skills in building simple projects, something as engaging to today’s youth as a mobile video game or app, participants may just discover a very employable field about which they are passionate. And for youth, developing a passion is key to positive self development, encourages self learning and the pursuit of a path into college or the workforce!</p>
